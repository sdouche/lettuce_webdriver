Requirements
============

* `lettuce <http://lettuce.it/>`_
* `selenium 2.0b2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium>`_
* `nose http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/`_

Setting Up lettuce_webdriver
============================

In your lettuce ``terrain.py`` file, add an include statement for lettuce to
learn about the additional step definitions provided by
``lettuce_webdriver`` and a setup that creates the selenium browser
desired::
    
    from lettuce import before, world
    from selenium import webdriver
    import lettuce_webdriver.webdriver
    
    @before.all
    def setup_browser():
        world.browser = webdriver.Firefox()

Usage
=====

lettuce stories are written in the standard Cucumber style of `gherkin
<https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/gherkin>`_. For example::
    
    Scenario: Filling out the signup form
      Given I go to "http://foo.com/signup"
       When I fill in "Name" with "Foo Bar"
        And I fill in "Email" with "nospam@gmail.com"
        And I fill in "City" with "San Jose"
        And I fill in "State" with "CA"
        And I uncheck "Send me spam!"
        And I select "Male" from "Gender"
        And I press "Sign up"
       Then I should see "Thank you for signing up!"
